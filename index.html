            Since Nijika is the paragon of human virtue without equal past or present,

            I should only think of fulfilling my loyalty. <br>
            <br>

            If Nijika has no fans, I no longer exist. <br>
            If the whole universe is for Nijika, then I am for the whole universe. <br>
            If the whole universe is against Nijika, then I am against the whole universe. <br>
            <br>
            I will love, cherish, and protect Nijika until my very last breath; <br>
            my successors will love, cherish and protect Nijika until their very last breath. <br>
