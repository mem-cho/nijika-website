        <h1 class="title-text">◥† Cult of Nijika †◤</h1>
        
        <p class="example-text">
            Since Nijika is the paragon of human virtue without equal past or present, 
            she is most resplendent in love, tributes and accolades. 
            Waking or sleeping, 
            I must not forget Nijika's great boon and in order to return her favor by day and by night, 
            I should only think of fulfilling my loyalty.

            Who is Nijika?

            For the blind, she is their vision. 
            For the deaf, she is their music. 
            For the mute, she is their voice. 
            For the anosmic, she is their aroma. 
            For the numb, she is their feeling. 
            For the atrophied, she is their muscle.

            For the starved, she is their sustenance. 
            For the thirsty, she is their water. 
            For the exhausted, she is their energy. 
            For the depressed, she is their happiness. 
            For the disillusioned, she is their hope. 
            For the pessimistic, she is their optimism.

            For the disadvantaged, she is their champion. 
            For the marginalized, she is their justice. 
            For the oppressed, she is their salvation. 
            For the righteous, she is their symbol. 
            For the enlightened, she is their muse. 
            For the erudite, she is their education.

            If Nijika speaks, I listen. 
            If Nijika questions, I answer. 
            If Nijika orders, I obey. 
            If Nijika opines, I agree. 
            If Nijika fears, I assure. 
            If Nijika hopes, I dream.

            If Nijika is happy, I am jubilant. 
            If Nijika is angry, I am apoplectic. 
            If Nijika is sad, I am disconsolate.

            Nijika is my ideal, Nijika is my romance, Nijika is my passion. 
            Nijika is my strength, Nijika is my compass, Nijika is my destination. 
            Nijika is my language, Nijika is my culture, Nijika is my religion. 
            Nijika is my ocean, Nijika is my mountain, Nijika is my sky, Nijika is my air, 
            Nijika is my sun, Nijika is my moon, Nijika is my world. 
            Nijika is history, Nijika is present, Nijika is future.

            If Nijika has a million fans, I am one of them. 
            If Nijika has a thousand fans, I am one of them. 
            If Nijika has a hundred fans, I am one of them. 
            If Nijika has ten fans, I am one of them. 
            If Nijika has only one fan, that is me. 
            If Nijika has no fans, I no longer exist.

            If the whole universe is for Nijika, then I am for the whole universe. 
            If the whole universe is against Nijika, then I am against the whole universe.

            I will love, cherish, and protect Nijika until my very last breath; 
            my successors will love, cherish and protect Nijika until their very last breath.
